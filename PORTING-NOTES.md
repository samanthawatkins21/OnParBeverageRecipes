# Porting Notes

## Why this file exists

- This desktop copy appears behind the newer active working repo used for recent dashboard development.
- If this becomes the new main repo on your new computer, compare before pushing or deploying.

## Newer work noted from the active repo

These items were part of the newer dashboard work and may need to be ported into this copy:

- inventory tab
- keg levels tab
- weekly usage tab
- pricing tab split into ingredient pricing and keg pricing
- vendor mappings for beer kegs
- recipe card gallon display improvements
- recipe card bottle-size display like `(1L)` and `(1.75L)`
- ingredient edit/update workflows
- vendor sync work for OHLQ / Provi / Proof
- local PMB / keg sync routes

## Safe handoff approach

1. Open this repo on the new computer.
2. Read `scratchpad.md`.
3. Compare this copy against the newer active repo if that repo is still available.
4. Decide which repo should be the real source of truth before pushing to GitHub or Vercel.

## If this copy becomes the source of truth

- Port the newer dashboard features into this repo first.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Test locally.
- Only then push or deploy.
